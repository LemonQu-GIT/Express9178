Well,

This is an API to extract any rational numbers to particular combinations of `"9", "1", "7", "8"` by using `+ - * / ^ sqrt() exp() ln()` methods.

Using `9 1 7 8` was just an ~~coincidence~~.

Anyway you can change the combination by modifying main.js and run

```bash
node ./main.js --export
```

to export `cache.json`.

I've tried C++ BFS method to solve but that's too slow.

So I used VibeCoding.
